## ✍️ Writing Guidelines

### Language and Tone

**✅ DO:**

- Use active voice: "You can apply online" not "Applications can be submitted online"
- Write in second person: "You need to bring..." not "Applicants need to bring..."
- Use simple words: "help" not "assistance"
- Be specific: "Bring 2 valid IDs" not "Bring identification"

**❌ DON'T:**

- Use government jargon: "LGU" instead of "local government"
- Use acronyms without explanation
- Write in third person
- Use passive voice unnecessarily

### Formatting Best Practices

#### Tables

Use tables for structured information:

```markdown
| Service         | Location           | Hours            | Contact        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Health Check-up | City Health Office | Mon-Fri, 8AM-5PM | (046) 460-4708 |
```

#### Lists

Use numbered lists for steps, bullet points for options:

```markdown
1. Go to the office
2. Fill out the form
3. Submit requirements

- Option 1: Online application
- Option 2: In-person application
- Option 3: Mail-in application
```

#### Headings

Use clear, descriptive headings:

```markdown
## How to Apply for a Business Permit

## What Documents Do You Need?

## Where to Get Help
```

## 🔧 Dynamic Content with Placeholders

Markdown pages can use `{PLACEHOLDER}` tokens for values that change between LGUs (official names, dates, etc.). Tokens are replaced at load time using a companion JSON file with the same slug.

### How It Works

| File             | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `executive.md`   | Markdown content with `{MAYOR}`, `{GOVERNMENT_NAME}` tokens |
| `executive.json` | Key-value pairs that supply the token values                |

Resolution order:

1. Value from the companion `.json` file
2. `VITE_<KEY>` environment variable
3. Token left unchanged (e.g. `{MAYOR}`)

### When to Use Placeholders

- Official names (mayor, vice mayor, department heads)
- LGU name and address
- Dates and election years
- Any value that differs per deployment

### When NOT to Use Placeholders

- Narrative paragraphs and descriptions — write these directly
- Content that changes frequently — update the markdown instead
- Values that don't vary across deployments

### Keeping JSON Files Updated

When officials change, **only update the JSON file** — no need to touch the markdown:

```json
{
  "MAYOR": "New Mayor Name",
  "YEAR_ELECTED": "2025"
}
```

## 🌐 Multilingual Content

### Language Considerations

1. **Primary Language**: Write in the language most citizens speak
