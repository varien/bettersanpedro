## Understanding the Content Structure

The website content is organized in two main sections under the `content` folder at the root level of the repository (not inside the `src` folder):

```
content/
├── government/
│   └── departments/         # Executive, legislative, and other department pages
└── services/
    ├── agriculture-fisheries/
    ├── business/
    ├── disaster-preparedness/
    ├── education/
    ├── environment/
    ├── garbage-waste-disposal/
    ├── health-services/
    ├── housing-land-use/
    ├── infrastructure-public-works/
    └── social-welfare/
```

### Three Types of Files

1. **Index Files** (`index.yaml`) — List all the pages in a category
2. **Content Files** (`.md` files) — The actual page content written in Markdown
3. **Data Files** (`.json` files) — Optional companion files that supply dynamic values (names, titles, dates) into the matching `.md` file using `{PLACEHOLDER}` tokens

---

## Editing Content Files

### Step 1: Navigate to the File

1. Go to the GitHub repository in your web browser
2. Click on the `content` folder (at the root level)
3. Click on `services` for service pages, or `government` for department/office pages
4. Choose the category folder (e.g., `education` or `departments`)
5. Click on the file you want to edit (e.g., `apply-for-local-scholarships.md` or `executive.md`)

### Step 2: Edit the File

1. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top-right corner of the file view
2. Make your changes in the text editor
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page

### Step 3: Save Your Changes

1. In the "Commit changes" section at the bottom:
   - **Commit message**: Write a brief description of what you changed
   - Example: "Updated scholarship application requirements"
2. Click **"Commit changes"** button

### Step 4: Verify Your Changes

1. The page will refresh and show your updated content
2. You can see the changes in the file history

## Adding New Services

### Method 1: Adding a New Service to an Existing Category

#### Step 1: Create the Content File

1. Navigate to the category folder (e.g., `education`)
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
3. Name the file using this format: `your-service-name.md`
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens
   - Example: `apply-for-summer-job-programs.md`
4. Add your content using the markdown format (see formatting guide below)
5. Click **"Commit new file"**

#### Step 2: Update the Index File

1. Go back to the category folder
2. Click on `index.yaml`
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Add your new service to the list:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: 'Your Service Name'
    slug: 'your-service-name'
    description: 'Brief description of the service.'
```

5. Save the changes

### Method 2: Creating a New Category

#### Step 1: Create the Category Folder

1. Go to `content/services/`
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
3. Name it: `your-category-name/index.yaml`
4. Add the basic structure:

```yaml
# Your Category Name Pages
# This file contains all the pages/services available under the Your Category Name category

pages:
  - name: 'Your First Service'
    slug: 'your-first-service'
    description: 'Description of your first service.'
```

#### Step 2: Create Service Content Files

Follow the same process as Method 1 to add individual service files.

## Adding Government Department Pages

Government department pages live under `content/government/` and follow the same two-file pattern as services.

### Editing an Existing Department Page

1. Navigate to `content/government/departments/`
2. Click on the department file you want to edit (e.g., `executive.md`)
3. Click the pencil icon, make your changes, and commit

### Adding a New Department Page

#### Step 1: Create the Content File

1. Navigate to `content/government/departments/`
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
3. Name the file: `your-department-name.md`
4. Add your content following the department page template (see Content Guide)
5. Click **"Commit new file"**

#### Step 2: Update the Index File

1. Go back to `content/government/departments/`
2. Click on `index.yaml`
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Add your new department to the list:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: 'Your Department Name'
    slug: 'your-department-name'
    description: 'Brief description of the department.'
```

5. Save the changes

### Using Dynamic Data in Department Pages

Department pages support `{PLACEHOLDER}` tokens that are automatically replaced with values from a companion JSON file of the same name. For example, `executive.md` can reference `{MAYOR}` and `{GOVERNMENT_NAME}`, which are defined in `executive.json`:

```json
{
  "GOVERNMENT_NAME": "Lapu Lapu City",
  "MAYOR": "Ma. Cynthia K. Chan",
  "MAYOR_HE_SHE": "she",
  "HONORIFIC_TITLE": "Honorable",
  "VICE_MAYOR": "Celedonio B. Sitoy",
  "VICE_MAYOR_HE_SHE": "he",
  "YEAR_ELECTED": "2022"
}
```

To update official names or titles, **edit only the JSON file** — the markdown content updates automatically. If no JSON file exists, placeholders fall back to environment variables (`VITE_MAYOR`, etc.) or are left as-is.

> **Note:** Adding a brand-new government _category_ (e.g., a section alongside `departments`) requires a developer to register it in `src/data/government.yaml` and `src/data/yamlLoader.ts`.

## Markdown Formatting Guide

Markdown is a simple way to format text. Here are the most common formatting options:

### Headers

```markdown
# Main Title (largest)

## Section Title

### Subsection Title

#### Smaller Title
```

### Text Formatting

```markdown
**Bold text**
_Italic text_
`Code or special terms`
```

### Lists

```markdown
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
  - Sub-bullet point

1. Numbered list item 1
2. Numbered list item 2
```

### Links

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Tables

```markdown
| Column 1     | Column 2     | Column 3     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
```

### Horizontal Lines

```markdown
---
```

### Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a quote or important note
```

---

## Best Practices

### Content Writing Tips

1. **Use Clear, Simple Language**
   - Write for the general public
   - Avoid technical jargon
   - Use short sentences and paragraphs

2. **Be Specific and Helpful**
   - Include exact steps to follow
   - Mention required documents
   - Provide contact information when possible

3. **Include Practical Information**
   - Office hours
   - Required documents
   - Processing time
   - Fees (if any)
   - Contact details

### Service Title and Description Pattern

When creating services, use this pattern for titles and descriptions to make them more citizen-friendly:

#### ✨ Pattern Formula

**[Action verb] + [service/benefit] + [who/where/why if needed]**

#### Guidelines

- **Start with an action verb**: Get, Access, Go, Join, Apply, Secure, Take, Receive
- **Keep it short and simple**: usually 5–10 words
- **Citizen-focused**: written in "you" language, no jargon
- **Outcome-based**: highlights the benefit or purpose of the service

#### Good Examples

- Apply for a Health Card for work or study
- Secure a Sanitary Permit for your business
- Take a free rabies vaccination after an animal bite
- Get free family planning counseling and services
- Receive free TB testing and medicines
- Access educational support programs from the LGU
- Join health programs for nutrition and dengue control
- Go to the local hospital for treatment or confinement

#### What to Avoid

❌ "Health Card Application Process" (too technical)

❌ "Sanitary Permit Requirements" (not action-oriented)

❌ "LGU Educational Support Services" (jargon-heavy)

✅ "Apply for a Health Card for work or study"

✅ "Secure a Sanitary Permit for your business"

✅ "Access educational support programs from the LGU"

### File Organization

1. **Use Descriptive File Names**
   - `apply-for-local-scholarships.md` ✅
   - `scholarship.md` ❌

2. **Keep Descriptions Short**
   - Index file descriptions should be 1-2 sentences
   - Focus on what the service does

3. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Use the same format for similar services
   - Follow the existing structure

### Content Structure Template

```markdown
# Service Name — Location

Brief introduction explaining what this service is for.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "I can't find the file I want to edit"

- For service pages: `content/services/[category]/`
- For government/department pages: `content/government/[category]/`
- Check if the file exists by looking at the folder contents
- Remember: the `content` folder is at the root level of the repository, not inside `src`

#### "My changes aren't showing up"

- Make sure you clicked "Commit changes" after editing
- Check that you're looking at the right file
- Wait a few minutes for changes to appear on the live site

#### "I made a mistake and want to undo changes"

- Go to the file you edited
- Click on "History" (clock icon)
- Find the version before your changes
- Click "Revert" to undo

#### "I can't create a new file"

- Make sure you have permission to edit the repository
- Check that you're in the right folder
- Try refreshing the page and starting over

#### "The formatting looks wrong"

- Check that you're using the correct markdown syntax
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Compare with existing files that work correctly

### Getting Help

If you're still having trouble:

1. **Check existing files for examples**

- Look at similar files to see how they're formatted
- Copy the structure of working files

2. **Ask for help**

- Contact the project administrator
- Ask a colleague who has used GitHub before

3. **Start small**

- Make small changes first to get comfortable
- Practice with less important content before editing critical information
